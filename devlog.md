Been thinking of the project for a while and I believe I can finish this in a couple of sessions. I will set up the GitHub repository and make my initial commits, then begin coding the project for find_exit/2.

Wrote the whole project in one session, did a lot of testing and debugging. Wrote find_exit, validate_maze containing validate_row and valid_cell, find_start to initialize a path starting point, follow_path, explore_maze, movement predicates and definitions. After debugging I did final tests and got basic maps and generated maps to output in display as well as finding exits for them. Additional note is the output looked weird in terminal so I did it in wsl where the output looked proper.
